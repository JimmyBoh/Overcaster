Overcaster
=========

The only desktop application built to design, manage, and serve HTML5 overlays for live broadcasts!


## How it Works

Create overlays using the power of HTML5! Behind the scenes it's really just a fully customizable and controllable web page with a transparent background.  When layered on top of other media you get a beautifully rendered UI that is easy to customize and interactive.

An example of this "layered UI" would be for any news/sports television station. Throughout the broadcast they render their logo, a latest news ticker, possibly the weather, and details of the current story. Now you can have the same cool effects, and more, all using the power of HTML!


## How to Build
Overcaster is now friends with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)!

### Windows:

    grunt dist-win

	
If you want to save yourself a few seconds during development you can prevent compression and auto-run the app with this:

    grunt debug-win


### Mac

    grunt dist-mac
	
** NOTE:** I do not have a Mac and therefore cannot build for it. If anyone would like to test and verify that everything is working then please feel free to do so and create a pull request with any updates (as well as your info for contributions).
 
 
### Linux

    grunt dist-linux

** NOTE:** I have not tested this yet, but potentially will in the future. If anyone would like to test and verify that everything is working then please feel free to do so and create a pull request with any updates (as well as your info for contributions).
