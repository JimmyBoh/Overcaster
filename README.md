Overcaster
=========

The only desktop application built to design, manage, and serve HTML5 overlays for live broadcasts!


## How it Works

Create overlays using the power of HTML5! Behind the scenes it's really just a fully customizable and controllable web page with a transparent background.  When layered on top of other media you get a beautifully rendered UI that is easy to customize and interactive.

An example of this "layered UI" would be for any news/sports television station. Throughout the broadcast they render their logo, a latest news ticker,possibly the weather, and details of the current story. Now you can have the same cool effects, and more, all using the power of HTML!


## How to Build
Currently only scripts for Windows exist, but feel free to create build scripts for Mac and Linux!

### Windows:
You will need the following applications and have them added to `PATH`
 - [7Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/)
 - [Enigma Virtual Box](http://enigmaprotector.com/en/aboutvb.html)
 
 Once both of those applications are installed and added to the system `PATH` just double click the `windows-release.bat`. The compiled `exe` will be created in the `release` folder.

 
 ### Mac
 Send me a pull request and I will gladly incorporate it!
 
 
 ### Linux
 Pull requests graciously accepted, but I will work on this eventually.
