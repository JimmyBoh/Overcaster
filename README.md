Overcaster
=========

Desktop application to design, manage, and serve HTML5 overlays for various applications.


## How it works

You create overlays using the power of HTML5! Behind the scenes it boils down to a fully customizable and controlable webpage with a transparent background.  When played on top of a video you get a beautifully rendered UI that is easy to customize and absolutely re-usable.



Possible uses:
 - Live streams (Open Broadcast Software + Browser Plugin)
 - Presentations
 - ... What ever else you can think of!
